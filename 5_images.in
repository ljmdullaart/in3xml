.h1 Images and others

.h2 Images

The simplest form of putting an image in the text is as a separate
construct:

.pre

 .img plaatje.png

.pre

.img plaatje.png

.img LEFT I.xcf

t is also possible to create an image on the left or the right
side and have text float around it. An example is this paragraph, which 
floats around a picture 
.fixed I.xcf
which seeks to imitate the nice capitalizations that you sometimes see
in medieval handwritings. The picture is included with
.fixed %.;img LEFT I.xcf.
Of course, in stead of
.fixed LEFT
, you may also opt 
to use
.fixed RIGHT
, and then the image is placed on the right side of the text.
Beware though: left and right floating pictures are not supported in combination
with left or side notes.
In addition,
.fixed FULL
will try to create a full-width image and 
.fixed HALF
will try to create a half page width image.

As examples, the next is the same
.fixed plaatje.png
as above with
.fixed FULL
specified:

.img FULL plaatje.png

and with 
.fixed HALF
:

.img HALF plaatje.png

An in-line picture is also possible, and it is not limited to
.img IMG_0364.xcf
guinea pigs like this.

.h2 Maps

In3 was originally written for web pages. On web pages, it is possible
to create a clickable map, with an area corresponding to a link. For
PS and PDF documents, In3 just includes the picture.

.pre
 .map image heap.png
 .map field top.html 0,0,95,95
 .map field http://dullaart.website/familie/index.html 125,125,250,250
 .map field http://dullaart.website/Winter/index.html 300,125,400,250
 .map field http://dullaart.website/borden/index.html 500,125,600,250
 .map field http://dullaart.website/paddestoel/index.html 697,130,827,245
.pre

will produce:

.map image heap.png
.map field top.html 0,0,95,95
.map field http://dullaart.website/familie/index.html 125,125,250,250
.map field http://dullaart.website/Winter/index.html 300,125,400,250
.map field http://dullaart.website/borden/index.html 500,125,600,250
.map field http://dullaart.website/paddestoel/index.html 697,130,827,245

.h2 Video

A video can be embedded in the text.

.video MVI_2308.MOV

In a web page, the video will play. On paper, that is a bit difficult,
so a picture of a frame in the video is used instead.


.h2 As part of other constructs

Images and video can be used in other constructs.

	<cs=2>In a table
	A video	.video MVI_2308.MOV
	An image	.img IMG_0364.xcf


And in a list:

- video
.video MVI_2308.MOV
- image
.img IMG_0364.xcf

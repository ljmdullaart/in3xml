.h2 My personal itch

Writing this kind of software is considered as "scratching your personal itch".
My personal itches for this project were threefold.

First, I needed something that produces consistent results for both PDF and 
HTML without too much manual intervention. Libreoffice does this, but delivered
just not exactly the type of web pages that I wanted. Dumping web pages to PDF
consistently gave half lines on the bottom and top. Groff's web pages are just
not good enough for me.

Secondly, I needed something that allows me to have notes in the right margin
of the text.
.side Like this
This is something that you commonly see in school books. I did not
find anything that could do that in an easy way. Publishing software require
too many mouse clicks to get the work done.

For the latest version, I needed to test some programming concepts, like XML,
Finite State Machine with stack, multi-pass parsing.

And, of course MY MOUSETRAP IS BETTER!!!

From the syntax in the input files, you will 
understand that I like
.fixed troff
and I do not care much about Tex. Indeed, I find Tex extremely 
cumbersome and it requires too much complex commands that have nothing
to do with the text.

Unlike
.fixed troff
or a macroset, In3 completely transforms the intput text. In, for example,
.fixed pic
it is possible to use \fB to embolden text. In In3, this  does not work.


.h2 Downloading
At this moment, there is not a neatly packaged 
in3. You can download the code from github
.link https://github.com/ljmdullaart/in3xml
or do 
.fix git clone https://github.com/ljmdullaart/in3xml
to get a clone of the source code.

.h2 History
In was a run-off format for web-pages. It was meant to create web pages 
of different formats. It worked quite well as long as the text was kept simple.

At some point, formatting requirements elaborate, using side-notes, tables and left-notes.
There was also the requirement of getting a PDF document, which was produced using tbl
and groff. I called this in2, having the nice pun in2html, in2groff etc.

By now, the code got quite complex. The difference between tables in HTML and tables in 
tbl made it necessary to duplicate a lot of code. Adding features became quite a 
challenge.

I also picked up a book called 'Clean Code' by Robert Martin. That described 
exactly the problem I was having; dirty code. 

So a major rewrite became necessary. And it also became necessary to create a
sort of architecture document that describes the way in looks at formatting 
a document. It also describes the in input language, the in3 intermediate language
and what in does or doesn't do. In general, the real formatting is left to the
output-processor (either the formatting of the web page or Groff).

Although a self-invented intermediate language is quite flexible, it also
introduced convoluted thinking. Therefore, the latest re-write now uses standard 
XML as intermediate language. This includes a DTD.

I have used the latest rewrite also as a test for some programming principles. That
means that I have written my own XML-parser. It also means that the in-language is
now parsed in multiple passes.

.h2 Requirements

To run in3, you must have on your system:

- perl
- groff
- tbl
- ghostscript
- ps2pdf
- imagemagic
- xmllint

To use all the features, you should also have

- Dia
- Gnuplot
- Tex
- Lillypond
- Configyour

.h2 Running in3xml

In3xml is designed to run with
.fix configyour
to create a Makefile. However, you can easily run it by hand, use your own Makefile or create 
a shellscript.

Configyour will scan for the pescence of the directory
.fix in3xml
to determine if it is applicable. If the directory
.fix roff
is present,
.fix groff
will be used to generate a PDF in that directory. All the intermediate files 
will be in the directory
.fix roff
too. If there is a directory
.fix web
then configyour will put HTML versions of the document there. A complete list of the 
directories that
.fix configyour
uses is in the table below.

	block	Put all pictures and blocks as picture in here
	htm	If this directory exist, put HTML versions wthout headers in this directory
	in3xml	Generate the rules for in3xml if this directtory exists; put the XML files in here
	roff	Put PDF, PS and intermediate files in this directory
	tag	General configyour directory for tagging and dependencies
	web	Put HTML versions of the document in here.


The image below can be used to determine the process flow.

	.b label	.b type	.b explanation
	%.;in	file	This is the input text. If configyour is used, the extension is used to determine what the input files are.
	meta.in	file	Meta.in is, if it exists, included before the input text
	in3multipass	program	Program that converts the .in file to XML
	%.;xml	file	XML version of the document
	xml3roff	program	Convertor from in3 XML to input for groff/
	xml3html	program	convertor from in3 XML to HTML
	%.;roff	file	Input file for groff
	%.;html	file	HTML output file
	%.;htm	file	HTML file, but without headers
	groff+	programs	Groff and its pre-processors. It is advised to always use tbl, pic and eqn, and use the in macroset (-min)
	%.;ps	file	Postscript output
	ps2pdf	program	Convertor for postscript to PDF
	stylesheet.mm	file	A style-sheet for groff.
	stylesheet.css	file	Stylesheet that is refered to in the .html file(s)
